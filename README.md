## About me

I'm a Software Engineer at [ICE Mortgage Technology](https://www.icemortgagetechnology.com/) where I work mostly on the frontend using [Angular](https://angular.io/) and do some backend with [Spring](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot). I studied Software Engineering at [Utah Valley University](uvu.edu). 

- I’m currently learning how to improve my [React](https://reactjs.org/) skills.
- What I want to learn next: [Remix](remix.run).
- I have messed around with the [Unity](https://unity.com/) game engine. [My itch.io page](https://schmeffgames.itch.io/)
